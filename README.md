# Palindrome Checker
This repository contains the implementation of a Palindrome Checker web application as part of an assginment from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-palindrome-checker-project/build-a-palindrome-checker). The project is a simple interactive webpage that allows users to input text and check whether the entered text is a palindrome or not. The focus is on clean design, user-friendly interaction, and responsiveness.

The webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, emphasizing accessibility and usability across devices.
